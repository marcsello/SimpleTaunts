# Simple Taunts

Based on KevinNovak's awesome [SimpleTauntMenu](https://github.com/KevinNovak/SimpleTauntMenu). Which was inspired by [Icedream](https://steamcommunity.com/id/icedream2k9)'s [Minimal PropHunt Taunt Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=431297319).

## Description

Simple Taunts the bare minimum if you want to add a taunt system (or override the built-in one) for ANY gamemode (but it was made with prop_hunt in mind). It ships only the minimum needed to make taunts work. It does not ship any soundfiles itself, and it's server-side only.

Just press and hold your `+menu_context` button (which is the "C" key by default) to bring up the taunt menu and click a taunt to begin taunting.

To play a random taunt press `gm_showspare1` (Default is the "F3" key).

**Note**: Players must be alive and not a spectator in order to taunt.

## Installation

This addon runs on the server-side, and it does not need any client side addon to be installed. Adding sound files, and ensuring they are downloaded for the clients is up to the server administrator! This addon does not care if the sound files are coming from another addon or directly added files on the server.
